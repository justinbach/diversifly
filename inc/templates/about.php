    <h2 class="subtitle">Butterflies are very diverse! Some are blue, some are yellow, some are orange, and some are several different colors combined.  Many butterflies also have spots on their wings that are called "eye spots" because they often look like eyes. Diversifly lets you explore the diversity of real butterflies with different numbers of eyespots and color combinations.</h2>

    <p class="body-copy">
   Why have different butterflies evolved different colors and different numbers of eye spots? Sometimes butterflies are brightly colored to warn predators that they are poisonous. In other cases, butterflies are colorful and have eye spots because these traits make them attractive to the opposite sex. Some butterflies distract predators with their eye spots to avoid getting eaten. Butterflies may also startle predators by flashing their brightly colored and spotted wings, giving them time to escape.
