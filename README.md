Diversifly is an interactive application that invites users to experience the diversity of species of butterflies. It was designed and developed for use in an exhibit at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, which is why the screen resolution it requires is larger than might be expected of an "ordinary" web application. It's also optimized for Chrome, which is the browser running on the kiosk at the Peabody, and may not function as intended on other browsers.
